<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>There may be two rows of different lengths in this matrix initialization.
                    MATLAB requires each row of a matrix to be the same length. Note that when
                    variables are included in a matrix initialization, Code Analyzer often cannot
                    determine whether the variable is a scalar or a vector. Therefore, it could fail
                    to find problems that appear when you run the code. Because Code Analyzer issues
                    this message conservatively, when it does display this message, there is
                    probably a problem.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Adjust the code so that all rows in the matrix are the same length.</p></body></html>
