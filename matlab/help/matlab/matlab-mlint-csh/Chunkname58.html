<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>A statement in a script appears to produce a value that will display when the
                    script runs. Although this is usually a problem in functions, it might be
                    desirable behavior in scripts.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>If you do not want the output to display for this statement, then terminate it
                    with a semicolon.</p><p>If you want the output to display, suppress this message, as described in

                    generates a different message to notify you of statements in functions that are
                    not terminated with a semicolon&#8212;that message is not affected when you
                    suppress this one.)</p></body></html>
