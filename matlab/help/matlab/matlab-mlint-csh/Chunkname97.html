<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Classes in MATLAB fall broadly into two categories&#8212;<a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_oop/matlab_oop.map'],'handle_classes_vs_value_classes')" target="_blank">handle classes and value classes</a>. While there are some similarities,
                    there are also significant usage differences for these classes. Code Analyzer
                    cannot always determine with certainty whether a class is a handle class or a
                    value class because it could inherit this property from its superclass. </p><p>Code Analyzer produces this message when it detects some usage patterns
                    characteristic of a value class and other usage patterns characteristic of a
                    handle class&#8212;an apparent conflict. Two other messages always accompany
                    this message, giving additional information about the behaviors Code Analyzer
                    has seen that suggest this conflict. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>It is very likely that there is a usage conflict. Examine the messages that
                    accompany this one and fix the usage that does not correspond to your intended
                    class behavior. If the class is derived from a superclass that is a handle
                    class, you can indicate this property directly in the class definition by
                    including the handle explicitly as a superclass, as shown in the following
                    example:</p><p>
                    <code>classdef&nbsp;myclass&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;superclass&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;handle</code>
                </p><p>This makes it clear to Code Analyzer (and others reading the class) that the
                    class is a handle class. This could be enough to suppress inappropriate
                    messages. In general, Code Analyzer cannot be certain that the problem exists
                    without evaluating additional files. Therefore, it could be appropriate to
                    suppress this message, as described in <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>.</p></body></html>
