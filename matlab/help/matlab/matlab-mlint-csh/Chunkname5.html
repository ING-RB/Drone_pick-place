<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>MATLAB has a nesting limit of 7 on block comments, and this file exceeds that
                    limit. Block comment indicators, <code>%{ </code> and
                        <code>%}</code>, must be the only characters on the lines on which
                    they appear. Therefore, code such as the following does not end a block
                    comment:</p><p>
                    <code>%}&nbsp;end&nbsp;of&nbsp;block&nbsp;comment</code>
                </p><p>This error could cause your file to appear to have deeply nested block
                    comments, when that was not your intent.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Make sure that you have specified block comment indicators properly. Review
                    the code in the Editor to ensure that the comments include only the lines that
                    you expect. If so, remove some levels of nesting. Removing inner block comments
                    lowers the nesting level.</p></body></html>
