<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>A variable is declared as <code><a href="matlab: doc persistent" target="_blank">persistent</a></code> in this script. However, variables can be
                    declared as persistent in functions only. In scripts, there is no function
                    workspace in which the variable can persist.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Rewrite the script as a function or use a class property that persists
                    naturally. If that is not possible, you can declare the variable as
                        <code>global</code> instead. However, be aware that the use of
                        <code>global</code> is discouraged because programs that use it can be
                    harder to maintain, extend, and use with other programs.</p></body></html>
