<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Additional Information</strong><br/><p>A variable declared as persistent is local to the function in which you
                    declare it; yet MATLAB retains its value in memory between calls to that
                    function. Persistent variables are known only to the function in which you
                    declare them. This prevents other functions or the MATLAB command line from
                    changing the value of the persistent variable.</p><p> When you clear or modify a function that is in memory, MATLAB also clears all
                    persistent variables declared by that function. To keep a function in memory
                    until MATLAB quits, use <code><a href="matlab:doc mlock" target="_blank">mlock</a></code>. </p><p> MATLAB returns an error if:<ul><li><p>You attempt to declare a variable persistent and another variable
                                with the same name exists in the current workspace. </p></li><li><p>You specify a variable as a function input or output argument, and
                                then try to declare that variable as persistent within the same
                                function. For example, the following persistent declaration is
                                invalid: </p><p>
                                <code>function&nbsp;myfun(argA)<br/>persistent&nbsp;argA</code>
                            </p></li></ul>
