                    interprets the variable in the parent function as a function
                    call.&nbsp;Otherwise, the variable is shared between parent and nested function.
                    This code might result in unintended behavior.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>To clarify which behavior you expect, modify your code.</p><ul><li><p>To share the variable between the parent and nested function, assign a
