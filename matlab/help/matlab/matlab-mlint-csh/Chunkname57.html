<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>A block of code is initiated by a reserved word, but the corresponding
                        <code>end</code> statement for this block does not appear to line up
                    with the opening statement. This message appears only if the
                        <code>end</code> is at least two lines lower than the opening reserved
                    word, and the number of indentation characters is off by more than one. Because
                    Code Analyzer counts a tab character and a single space as one character each,
                    you are likely to see this message if you mix tabs and spaces to indent text.
                    Even though the code appears aligned to you, Code Analyzer interprets it as
                    misaligned.</p><p>The most common cause for this message is a missing or extra
                        <code>end</code> statement, which causes the <code>end</code>
                    statements to be paired with the wrong reserved words.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Realign the reserved word and add the missing <code>end</code> statement as
                    appropriate. If you frequently mix tabs and spaces and do not want to make them
                    consistent, then suppress all instances of this message in the file or disable
                    all instances of this message in all files, as described in <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>.</p></body></html>
