<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>It appears this statement produces a value that displays at the command line
                    when the statement executes. This is usually undesirable in functions, because
                    someone else calling the function might not expect or need the output. Sometimes
                    (usually due to overloading), Code Analyzer is incorrect and the expression
                    produces no output.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Because there is little harm in putting a semicolon after the statement even
                    if the statement does not result in displaying output, use the context menu to
                    add a semicolon. If the message is incorrect, suppress it as described in <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>.</p></body></html>
