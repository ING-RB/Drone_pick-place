<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>If any statements, even empty statements, precede a function definition,
                    MATLAB considers the file a script. Empty statements include a comma or
                    semicolon appearing outside of a comment and before a function definition. If
                    MATLAB considers the file a script, any functions defined in the file are local
                    functions. You cannot call local functions from other files or from the command
                    line.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>If you intend for the file to be a function file, such that the first function
                    is the main function, remove any statements above the function
                    definition.</p></body></html>
