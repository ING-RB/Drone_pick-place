<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Two consecutive dots does not comprise a valid MATLAB construction. This
                    message might indicate a typographical error. For example, if you meant to
                    specify the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) line continuation operator, but
                    accidentally specified two dots instead of three. Or, if you did not insert a
                    space before the ellipsis, when needed.</p><p>For example, in processing the following line, Code Analyzer generates this
                    message because the first dot is evaluated as a decimal point associated with
                    the 3, leaving two consecutive dots: </p><p>
                    <code>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;3...</code>
                </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Fix the code by adding or removing a dot, or by inserting a space before the
                    ellipsis (<code>...</code>).</p></body></html>
