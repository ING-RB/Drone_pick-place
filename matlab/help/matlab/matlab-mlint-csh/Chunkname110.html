<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Although it rarely occurs, when this message displays, it is typically caused
                    by one or more syntax errors in the file. After a syntax error, Code Analyzer
                    attempts to process the rest of the file, assuming a particular fix to the
                    syntax error. However, there can be many different kinds of errors, and what
                    Code Analyzer assumes is a fix might not be a fix to the actual problem. This
                    assumption can lead Code Analyzer to detect inconsistencies in its own internal
                    data structures, and elicit this message. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>In most cases, syntax errors display in red when the file is open in the
                    Editor. Fixing these errors usually eliminates this message. If this message
                    displays when there are no other errors in the file, it exposes a bug in Code
                    Analyzer. In that case, submit this message and the file information to customer
                    support as follows:<ol><li><p>Go to <a href="matlab:web(' https://www.mathworks.com/support/contact_us.html')">https://www.mathworks.com/support/contact_us.html</a></p></li><li><p>Select <strong class="guilabel">Product Usage</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong class="guilabel">Report a bug</strong>, and then answer the
                                questions. </p></li></ol></p></body></html>
