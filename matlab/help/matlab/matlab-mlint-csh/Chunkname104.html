<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Code Analyzer has identified a variable that appears to be a
                        <code>struct</code>. It also appears that this
                        <code>struct</code> variable had one or more fields changed, but the
                    code never uses the variable, nor is the variable returned. This scenario
                    indicates that the assignment to the variable has no effect. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Although Code Analyzer generates this message conservatively, it is possible
                    for Code Analyzer to identify the variable incorrectly as a <code><a href="matlab:doc struct" target="_blank">struct</a></code> when it actually
                    is an object. It is possible for an assignment to an object property to have
                    side effects that make this assignment appropriate. If the object is a handle
                    object, this usage is not only appropriate, but common. </p><p> If the message is appropriate, you can either:<ul><li><p> Remove the assignment, if it is not useful</p></li><li><p>Correct the program so that it either assigns or returns the
                                value</p></li></ul></p><p> If the message is inappropriate, do one of the following:<ul><li><p>Suppress the message for this assignment.</p></li><li><p>Suppress the message for the entire file.</p></li><li><p>Suppress this message for all files, if your programming style is
                                such that this message frequently appears inappropriately.</p></li></ul>For details, see <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>.</p></body></html>
