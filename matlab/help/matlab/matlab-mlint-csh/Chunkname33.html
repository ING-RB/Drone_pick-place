<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>This message indicates that the <code>for</code> loop will run correctly
                    as a <code>parfor</code> loop if you make no other changes to the loop.
                </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Consider converting the indicated <code><a href="matlab:doc for" target="_blank">for</a></code> loop to a <code><a href="matlab:doc parfor" target="_blank">parfor</a></code> loop. Whether or
                    not this is desirable depends on the size of the loop, how much data will be
                    transferred to MATLAB workers as a result, and how much work is done on each
                    iteration of the loop. </p><p>This message is off by default. You might enable it to look for instances that
                    are easily changed, and then disable it. Or, you might leave it enabled all the
                    time. If you leave this message enabled all the time, you should suppress it for
                    any <code>for</code> loops that Code Analyzer indicates as candidates for
                    conversion to <code>parfor</code> loops, but that you decided not to
                    convert. In such instances, MathWorks recommends you include a comment about why
                    you did not make the conversion. </p><p>For more information, see <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>.</p></body></html>
