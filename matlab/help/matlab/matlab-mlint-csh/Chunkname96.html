<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Classes in MATLAB fall broadly into two categories&#8212;<a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_oop/matlab_oop.map'],'handle_classes_vs_value_classes')" target="_blank">handle classes and value classes</a>. While there are some similarities,
                    there are also significant usage differences for these classes. Code Analyzer
                    cannot always determine with certainty whether a class is a handle class or a
                    value class, because it may inherit this property from its superclass. </p><p>Code Analyzer produces this message because it has seen some usage patterns
                    characteristic of a value class, and other usage patterns characteristic of a
                    handle class&#8212;an apparent conflict. Two other messages always accompany
                    this message, giving additional information about the behaviors Code Analyzer
                    has seen suggesting this conflict. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>The evidence strongly supports a usage conflict. Examine the messages that
                    accompany this one and fix the usage that does not correspond to your intended
                    class behavior. If the class is derived from a superclass that is a handle
                    class, you can indicate this property directly in the class definition by
                    including the handle explicitly as a superclass, as shown in the following
                    example:</p><p>
                    <code>classdef&nbsp;myclass&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;superclass&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;handle</code>
                </p><p>This makes it clear to Code Analyzer (and others reading the class) that it is
                    a handle class. This could be enough to suppress inappropriate messages.</p></body></html>
