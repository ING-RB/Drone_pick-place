<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Code Analyzer returns this message when an assignment sets the indicated
                    variable in a script, but it appears the script does not use the assigned value.
                    This is not a problem if the caller of the script uses the assigned
                    value.</p><p>Programmers use scripts for many different purposes in MATLAB. Some scripts
                    are standalone programs, such as demos. Because unused assignments might
                    indicate programming errors in standalone programs, it is appropriate to enable
                    this message for these scripts.</p><p>Programmers use other scripts to initialize variables, and the whole purpose
                    of such scripts is to assign values that their caller uses. For these scripts,
                    there is no problem&#8212;the message is inappropriate.</p><p>This message is disabled by default, but you can enable it to check standalone
                    scripts. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Enable this message to see what type of messages Code Analyzer generates for
                    your scripts.</p><p>If most of your scripts are standalone scripts, you might want to enable this
                    message in the preferences panel. Then, disable this message on a file-by-file
                    basis, as described in <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>, for those
                    scripts whose whole purpose is to initialize variables.</p><p>If all of your scripts are for initializing variables, keep this message
                    disabled in the preferences panel.</p></body></html>
