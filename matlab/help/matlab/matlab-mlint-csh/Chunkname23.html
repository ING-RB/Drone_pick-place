<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>MATLAB runs loops in <code>parfor</code> functions by dividing the
                    loop iterations into groups, and then sending them to MATLAB workers where they
                    run in parallel. For MATLAB to do this in a repeatable, reliable manner, it must
                    be able to classify all the variables used in the loop. The code uses the
                    indicated variable in a way that is incompatible with classification. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Fix the usage of the indicated variable. </p><p>For more information about variable classification and other restrictions on
