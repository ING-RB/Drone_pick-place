<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Code Analyzer reached a built-in limit while processing the file. Because Code
                    Analyzer enforces some built-in limits more strictly than MATLAB software, this
                    file could run, despite this message. Some of the built-in limits are intended
                    to prevent errors which are fatal in the operating systems on which MATLAB runs.
                    Other limits are intended to prevent the waste of time and memory that could
                    occur if Code Analyzer attempts to process a corrupt file.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Divide your file into smaller script files and have each invoke the next in a
                    sequence that matches the original file order. Divide function files into
                    several files. Divide very large functions into calls of local functions or
                    nested functions. Not only do the tools work more efficiently when you do this,
                    but you and others can more easily understand, change, and debug the resulting
                    files.</p></body></html>
