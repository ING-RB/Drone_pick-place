                    does not open and play virtual world animation files. With appropriate code
                    changes, use sim3d classes to create and view a 3D environment instead. For
                    alternate functionality, see <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/sl3d/transition-virtual-reality-world-to-unreal-engine-3d-environment.html'])" target="_blank">Transition Virtual Reality World to Unreal Engine 3D
