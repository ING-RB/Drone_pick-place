<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>The code contains an expression that is too complex for code analysis to
                    handle. Instead of providing complete code analysis, this message appears for
                    the first line of code in this file. The expression causing the problem can be
                    anywhere within the code.</p><p>Possible causes of code complexity include:<ul><li><p>Too many concurrent indexing operators.</p></li><li><p>Too many concurrent suffixed unary operators, e.g.
                                    <code>x'''''...</code></p></li><li><p>Too many concurrent binary operators, e.g. <code>a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d
                                    &gt; ...</code>.</p></li></ul></p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Run <code><a href="matlab:doc checkcode" target="_blank">checkcode</a></code> from the Command Window to view all the
                            messages for this file.</p></li><li><p>Correct the reported problems.</p></li></ol><p>If this message persists after correcting the other problems, attempt to
                    simplify the code. For instance, reduce the levels of nested expressions and
                    make long expressions shorter wherever possible. Not only do the tools work more
                    efficiently when you make such changes, but you and others can more easily
                    understand, change, and debug the resulting code.</p></body></html>
