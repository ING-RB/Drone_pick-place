<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>A class definition can reference properties, methods, or events only when they
                    are defined in the class or in one of its superclasses.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>To reference a property, method, or event of this class:<ul><li><p>Fix the code on the indicated line if the property, method, or
                                event has been defined in the class.</p></li><li><p>Define the property, method, or event in the class if the
                                property, method, or event has not been defined.</p></li></ul></p><p>If you want to use a property or method in this class but you want subclasses
                    to provide its implementation, declare the property or method as an
                        <code>Abstract</code> property or method in this class.</p></body></html>
