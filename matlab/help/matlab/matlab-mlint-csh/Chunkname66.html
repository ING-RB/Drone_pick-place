<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p> If the name of the main function does not match the name of the file that
                    contains it, MATLAB ignores the function name and uses the file name instead.
                    Sometimes this occurs when you move a function from one file to another, but do
                    not change the name of the function. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Change the main function name so that it matches the file name. </p></body></html>
