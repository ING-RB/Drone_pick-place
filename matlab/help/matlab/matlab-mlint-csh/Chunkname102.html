<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Scripts are used for several different purposes in MATLAB. In some cases, such
                    as for examples, a script is a standalone file that runs by itself. In other
                    cases, scripts are used to initialize variables in functions or other utility
                    tasks. The messages appropriate for one style of script are not always
                    appropriate for the other.</p><p>Code Analyzer has found a variable in a script that the script appears to use,
                    but not set. This might represent a problem in a standalone script, but be
                    acceptable in other kinds of scripts. This message is off by default, but can be
                    enabled, as appropriate.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>If this message has detected a problem in the script, fix the problem.
                    Otherwise, suppress the message on this line, for the entire script. Or, if you
                    commonly do this kind of coding, leave the message disabled in your default Code
