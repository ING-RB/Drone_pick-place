<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>MATLAB enforces a nesting limit of 15 for functions. This message appears when
                    one or more of the following is true:</p><ul><li><p>Some of the functions in the file are written with
                                <code>end</code> statements and others are not.</p><p>When Code Analyzer examines the file, it checks to see if functions
                            terminate with <code>end</code> statements. If the functions are
                            not nested, you can omit their corresponding <code>end</code>
                            statements. However, the same file cannot have some functions with
                                <code>end</code> statements and some without. </p></li><li><p>There is an extra <code>end</code> statement in the file and it
                            appears to Code Analyzer that it matches a <code>function</code>
                            keyword. </p><p>For example, suppose your code has nested <code>for</code> loops
                            and multiple unnested functions without <code>end</code>
                            statements. Furthermore, suppose there is an extra
                                <code>end</code> statement for one of the
                                <code>for</code> loops. If that <code>end</code>
                            statement appears to match a function keyword, Code Analyzer interprets
                            it as the situation described in the first item in this list.</p></li><li><p>Functions with <code>end</code> statements are nested more than
                            15 deep.</p></li></ul><p> In the first two cases, additional messages might indicate where the extra
                        <code>end</code> is. Code Analyzer indicates keywords that do not
                    align with their matching <code>end</code> keywords. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>If the message is due to mixing <code>function</code> keywords with and
                    without corresponding <code>end</code> statements, fix the function style
                    to be consistent. If there are extra <code>end</code> statements in the
                    file by mistake, remove them. If you want more than 16 levels of nesting,
                    consider using the MATLAB class system. Often the function nesting level drops
                    and the code becomes simpler to understand when you use classes instead of
                    nested functions.</p></body></html>
