<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>The size of the indicated variable or array appears to be changing with each
                    loop iteration. Commonly, this message appears because an array is growing by
                    assignment or concatenation. Growing an array by assignment or concatenation can
                    be expensive. For large arrays, MATLAB must allocate a new block of memory and
                    copy the older array contents to the new array as it makes each assignment. </p><p>Programs that change the size of a variable in this way can spend most of
                    their run time in this inefficient activity. There is also significant overhead
                    in shrinking an array on each iteration or in changing the size of a variable on
                    each iteration. In such cases, MATLAB must reallocate and copy the contents
                    repeatedly.</p><p>For scripts, Code Analyzer cannot determine whether the array was preallocated
                    before the script was called. Depending on your use of scripts, you might want
                    to enable or disable this message independently of the related message (with
                    message ID AGROW) that applies to functions and class methods. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Consider preallocating a variable or array before entering the loop by using
                            <code><a href="matlab:doc zeros" target="_blank">zeros</a></code>,
                            <code><a href="matlab:doc ones" target="_blank">ones</a></code>,
                            <code><a href="matlab:doc cell" target="_blank">cell</a></code>, or
                    a similar function. Preallocating avoids the need for MATLAB to copy the data
                    from one array to another inside the loop. For examples of code that do and do
                    not preallocate an array, see <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'prog_prealloc_arrays')" target="_blank">“Preallocating Arrays”</a></p><p>When an array grows by assigning past the end of the array or using
                    concatenation, preallocation alone does not improve the performance. The code
                    must use explicit indices also.</p><p>Assigning to an array in a script that the caller of the script preallocated
                    provides an opportunity to create bugs that are difficult to detect. If the
                    script is called multiple times, these bugs are particularly difficult to
                    detect. However, there are other uses of scripts where preallocating in this
                    manner is necessary or even desirable. In this case, suppress the message for
                    specific assignments or for the whole script, as described in <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>. It might also
                    be appropriate to suppress this message if any of the following is true:<ul><li><p>The loop code is searching for rare or exceptional events
                                (especially if you do not expect it to find any).</p><p>In this case, it can be reasonable to grow the array only as the
                                loop code finds such events.</p></li><li><p>The array is small and will always be small.</p><p>In this case, the impact of recopying is also small.</p></li><li><p>The array was preallocated, but in a way that Code Analyzer does
                                not recognize.</p></li></ul></p><p>If you do not know the size of an array before the loop begins, preallocate
                    it, and then shrink it, if necessary, after the loop completes.</p></body></html>
