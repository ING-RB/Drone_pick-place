<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>This <code>for</code> loop is fine as it is, but will generate warnings
                    if replaced with a <code>parfor</code> loop. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>See the other messages that accompany this one. Note that these other messages
                    do not necessarily indicate a problem in your current code, but rather problems
                    that you will see if you convert the <code><a href="matlab:doc for" target="_blank">for</a></code> loops to <code><a href="matlab:doc parfor" target="_blank">parfor</a></code> loops. By default, this message is off. You can turn it
                    on when you are considering converting some or all of the <code>for</code>
                    loops in a file to <code>parfor</code> loops. When the conversion is
                    complete, you should disable this message again until needed. </p></body></html>
