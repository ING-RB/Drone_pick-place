<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>It appears that the index value of the indicated <code>for</code> loop
                    changes inside the loop body. Often, this happens when loops nest and an inner
                    loop reuses the name of an outer loop index. Because MATLAB resets the loop
                    index to the next value when it returns to the top of the outer loop, it ignores
                    any changes that took place within a nested loop. If the code does not to refer
                    to the outer loop index value after the inner loop changes it, no problem
                    results. However if you attempt to use the outer loop index value after the
                    inner loop completes, it is likely to result in a bug.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Change the name of one of the <code><a href="matlab:doc for" target="_blank">for</a></code> loop indexes. If you must keep them as is, add a
                    comment documenting the need and suppress the message as described in <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>.</p></body></html>
