<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>If you use the <code>end</code> keyword within parentheses, MATLAB
                    expects it is to index into array variables. The <code>end</code> in
                    this code does not appear to be used as an index into an array variable.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>If the code has an error, such as an incorrect function call or typographical
                    error, correct the code.</p><p>If <code>end</code> is used to index into an array variable, and the
                    variable was introduced implicitly, consider defining the variable explicitly
                    before indexing into it. For example, you can define a variable explicitly by
                    initializing it. Explicit variable definition indicates that the variable is
                    indeed a variable and not a function that has the same name.</p><p>If Code Analyzer generated this message incorrectly, consider suppressing the
                    message as described in <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>.</p></body></html>
