<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Code Analyzer reached a built-in limit while processing the file. Some of the
                    built-in limits are intended to prevent errors which are fatal in the operating
                    systems on which MATLAB runs. Other limits are intended to prevent the waste of
                    time and memory that could occur if the Code Analyzer attempts to process a
                    corrupt file. Instead of providing complete code analysis, this message appears
                    for the first line of code in this file.</p><p>Possible causes include:<ul><li><p>Too many nested conditionals or switch statements.</p></li><li><p>Too many nested functions/nested anonymous functions.</p></li><li><p>Too many prefixed operators, e.g.
                                <code>...-+-+-+-+-x</code>.</p></li></ul></p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Divide your file into smaller script files and have each invoke the next in a
                    sequence that matches the original file order. Divide function files into
                    several files. Divide very large functions into calls of local functions or
                    nested functions. Not only do the tools work more efficiently when you do this,
                    but you and others can more easily understand, change, and debug the resulting
                    files.</p></body></html>
