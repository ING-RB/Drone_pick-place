                    that check variable scope.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Refactor any code that uses <code>isglobal</code>.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you
                    need to convert your code quickly in the short term, replace
                        <code>isglobal</code> with
                        <code>~isempty(whos('global','variable'))</code>.&nbsp; However, you
                    should refactor your code to avoid conditional checks on variable scope.</p></body></html>
