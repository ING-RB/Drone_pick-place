<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Additional Information</strong><br/><p>A variable declared as global in multiple functions (and optionally the base
                    workspace) share a single copy of that variable. Any assignment you make to that
                    variable in one function is available to all functions that declare it
                    global.</p><p>If you intentionally use a variable in this manner, it is not a problem. </p><p>However, if you unintentionally use a variable in this manner, it can result
                    in unexpected behavior. If the highlighting indicates that the scope of a
                    variable spans multiple functions, and that was not your intent, remove the
                    global declaration from the variable.</p><p>For more information on variables and the workspace, see <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'global_variables')" target="_blank">Global Variables</a>.</p><br/></body></html>
