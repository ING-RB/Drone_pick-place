<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Additional Information</strong><br/><p>Variables within nested functions are accessible to more than just their
                    immediate function. A variable, <code>x</code>, to which you assign a
                    value or use within a nested function resides in the workspace of the outermost
                    function that both contains the nested function and accesses
                        <code>x</code>. Therefore, the scope of <code>x</code> is the
                    function to which this workspace belongs, and all functions nested to any level
                    within that function.</p><p>If you intentionally use a variable in this manner, it is not a problem. For
                    examples, see the MATLAB Programming Demo on Nested Functions.</p><p>However, if you unintentionally use a variable in this manner, it can result
                    in unexpected behavior. If the highlighting indicates that the scope of a
                    variable spans multiple functions, and that was not your intent,
                    consider:</p><ul><li><p>Renaming the nested function variable so it does not match the outer
                            function variable name.</p></li><li><p>Passing the variable into the function as an input argument instead of
                            using the variable directly within the nested function.</p></li></ul><p>For more information, see <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'nested_functions_scope')" target="_blank">Variable Scope in Nested Functions</a>.</p><br/></body></html>
