<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Within array initializations, when a line ends with a comma, rather than an
                    ellipsis line continuation indicator (<code>...</code>), MATLAB ignores
                    the comma and the new line takes precedence. Thus, MATLAB interprets a new line
                    as a new row. Your use of a comma suggests that you are trying to create a row
                    vector, rather than a column vector. This might not matter because row and
                    column vectors work the same way in many situations.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>To specify a row vector, insert an ellipsis (<code>...</code>) after the
                    comma at the end of the row. To specify a column vector, remove the comma or
                    replace it with a semicolon, so that your intentions are clear. If you prefer to
                    leave your code as is, then suppress the message or turn it off in the
                    preferences panel, as described in <a href="../matlab_prog/check-code-for-errors-and-warnings.html#brqxeeu-167" class="a">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>.</p></body></html>
