<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>The code compares two character vectors using either the equal to (==) or not
                    equal to (~=) relational operator. MATLAB software returns an error at run time
                    if the vectors being compared are different lengths. Even if MATLAB does not
                    return an error when the code runs, it is likely that this code is
                    inefficient.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Use the <code><a href="matlab:doc strcmp" target="_blank">strcmp</a></code> function
                    instead of a relational operator to compare two pieces of text. </p></body></html>
