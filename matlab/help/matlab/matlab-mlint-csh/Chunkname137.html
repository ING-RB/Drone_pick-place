<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>A class definition can reference properties only when they are defined in the
                    class or in one of its superclasses.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>To reference a property of this class:<ul><li><p>Fix the code on the indicated line if the property has been
                                defined in the class.</p></li><li><p>Define the property in the class if the property has not been
                                defined.</p></li></ul></p><p>If you want to use the property in this class but you want subclasses to
                    provide its implementation, declare it as an <code>Abstract</code>
                    property in this class.</p></body></html>
