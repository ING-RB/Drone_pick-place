<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>The indicated token appears to be the beginning of a statement that is not
                    preceded by a separator (a comma, semicolon, or newline). Following conditional
                    expressions inside of <code>if</code>, <code>elseif</code>, and
                        <code>while</code> statements with a separator makes it clear and
                    unambiguous where the expression ends and the next statement begins.</p><p>Sometimes, this message arises from a typographical error. For example, if you
                    type:</p><code>&nbsp;if&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;~&nbsp;&nbsp;b<br/></code><p>when you meant to type:</p><code>&nbsp;if&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;~=&nbsp;&nbsp;b<br/></code><p>then MATLAB interprets <code>a</code> as the conditional expression, and
                        <code>~ b</code> as a statement to execute. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>If the indicated token is the beginning of the next statement, precede the
                    statement with a comma, semicolon, or newline character. If the message is the
                    result of a typographical error, then correct it.</p></body></html>
