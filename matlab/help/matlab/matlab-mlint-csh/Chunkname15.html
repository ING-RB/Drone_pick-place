<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>A <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/matlab/ref/parfor.html'])" target="_blank"><code>parfor</code></a> loop contains <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/matlab/ref/break.html'])" target="_blank"><code>break</code></a> statements. The
                        <code>parfor</code> statement works by breaking up iterations of a
                    loop and running these iterations on multiple MATLAB workers. Using
                        <code>break</code> statements implies that later iterations of the
                    loop should not run after either of these two statements execute. Therefore, the
                    loop iterations must run in sequence. However, for the <code>parfor</code>
                    loop to be valid, the result of running the successive loop iterations must not
                    depend on the order in which they run.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Transform the program so that loop iterations do not depend on the results of
                    other loop iterations.</p></body></html>
