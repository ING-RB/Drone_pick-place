<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>In analyzing a <code>parfor</code> loop, Code Analyzer has found a
                    reduction variable that appears to be using a nonbroadcast variable reference as
                    the reduction function. A reduction function must be either a function name or a
                    broadcast variable. This message typically appears because there is an
                    assignment to the named reduction function within the
                        <code>parfor</code> loop.</p><p> For more information, see the topics on broadcast variables and reduction
                    assignments under <a href="matlab:helpview('parallel-computing','PARFOR_CLASSIFICATION_OF_VARIABLES')" target="_blank">Classification of Variables in parfor-Loops</a>.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Ensure that you intend for the reduction to be within the loop, and that you
                    define the variable used for the reduction function before the loop.</p></body></html>
