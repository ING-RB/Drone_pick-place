<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>The program has at least one keyword that is missing a required
                            <code><a href="matlab: doc end" target="_blank">end</a></code>
                    statement. Code Analyzer attempts to identify and print the last keyword for
                    which there is no <code>end</code> statement. Although there is definitely
                    a missing <code>end</code> statement, it is possible that the indicated
                    keyword is not the one that needs to be fixed. Code Analyzer cannot always
                    accurately determine which keyword is missing the <code>end</code>
                    statement.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Determine which keyword is missing an <code>end</code> statement, and
                    supply it. If it is not obvious where the missing <code>end</code>
                    statement is needed, insert an <code>end</code> statement at the end of
                    the program. Then, look for new messages indicating that there are keywords not
                    aligned with their <code>end</code> statement.</p><p>For a list of MATLAB keywords, type <code><a href="matlab: doc iskeyword" target="_blank">iskeyword</a></code> in the
                    Command Window.</p></body></html>
