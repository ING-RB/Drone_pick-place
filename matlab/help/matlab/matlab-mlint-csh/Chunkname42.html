<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>It appears that the index value of a <code>for</code> loop changes
                    within a nested function. In some cases, nested functions can be called by
                    callbacks or other function calls leading to the loop index changing. This kind
                    of bug is exceptionally hard to find, so Code Analyzer signals this situation
                    even though in many cases the usage is benign.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Change the name of the <code><a href="matlab:doc for" target="_blank">for</a></code> loop index or the variable of the same name in the
                    nested function. If you must keep them as is, add a comment indicating the need
                    and suppress the message as described in <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '/techdoc/matlab_prog/matlab_prog.map'],'matlab_suppressing_mlint')" target="_blank">Adjust Code Analyzer Message Indicators and Messages</a>.</p></body></html>
