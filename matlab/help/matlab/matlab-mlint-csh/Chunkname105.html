<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>Code Analyzer cannot resolve the types of variables in this region of the
                    program consistently, which can indicate a bug or inefficiency in the code. For
                    example, the code might assign different types to a variable. Furthermore, due
                    to the dynamic nature of MATLAB, other messages in this region of the program
                    might be incorrect. </p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Review your code, including a search for typographical errors, and make sure
                    the code assigns types to variables appropriately. Even if your code assigns
                    types appropriately and is correct technically, consider rewriting it to clarify
                    your intent. Typically, if Code Analyzer cannot analyze your code correctly,
                    people can have difficultly understanding it as well. In addition, rewriting
                    your code may resolve this message and any erroneous messages that appear in
                    this region of the code.</p><p>If you prefer to keep your code as it is, suppress the message as described in
