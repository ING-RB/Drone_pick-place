<!DOCTYPE HTML><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><strong>Explanation</strong><br/><p>To keep MATLAB software running efficiently, MATLAB limits the depth to which
                    you can nest parentheses, brackets, and braces. This file has exceeded that
                    limit. Each left parenthesis, square bracket, or brace must have a matching
                    right parenthesis, bracket, or brace. This message appears primarily when
                        <code>.m </code> programs are written by other programs, and typically
                    when the resulting <code>.m</code> programs initialize large data
                    structures.</p><br/><strong>Suggested Action</strong><br/><p>Because code that exceeds the nesting limit also fails when you run that code,
                    is important to fix the problem. If a program is generating the file, you can
                    try modifying the program so it generates less nesting.</p></body></html>
