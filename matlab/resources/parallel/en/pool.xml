      <entry key="CannotAttachPackageFiles" context="error">Cannot attach files belonging to a Package because the workers do not support "Packages". Start MATLAB without the "-packages" option, or use the "Processes" Cluster profile.</entry>

      <entry key="FailedToBindInRange" context="error">Failed to open any port in the range [{0,number,integer} {1,number,integer}]. Verify that at least one port is available in this range and not in use by another process on this machine. Cause:\n{2}.</entry>

      <entry key="RemoteExecutionSlowToStart" context="warning">Insufficient workers from the parallel pool are available for remote execution to begin after waiting {0} seconds. This could be because one or more required parallel pool workers are busy executing PARFEVALs. If this is expected, you may disable this warning using {1}.</entry>

The parent cluster profile has the NumThreads property set to a maximum of {0,number,integer}, but {1,number,integer} thread-workers were requested.
