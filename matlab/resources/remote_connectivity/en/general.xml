            Unable to connect to MATLAB Connector on this machine.\n
            Try these steps:\n
            1. Retry your previous action.\n
            2. Confirm that the login credentials for MATLAB and MATLAB Connector are same.\n
            3. Click "Open MATLAB Connector", if a browser pop-up requests permission to open MATLAB Connector.\n
            4. MATLAB Connector must be installed and running on the machine. For information to install MATLAB Connector, &lt;a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/supportpkg/arduino_ug/install-matlab-connector.html"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.\n 
            5. Click on the MATLAB Connector icon on the taskbar and check for any reported issues. Also, ensure the Hardware Connectivity is turned on.\n
            6. Ensure a stable network connection.\n
