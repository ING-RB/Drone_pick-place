    <entry key="ChecksumMismatchOnDeserialization">
      There was a checksum mismatch while loading data for Archive with identifier ''{0}''. 
    </entry>

    <entry key="ChecksumEmptyOnSerialization">
      The checksum is empty for object identifier ''{0}'', so checksum match
      will not be possible on deserialization. Make sure the traits add an item
      to checksum or alternatively, disable checksum tracking.
    </entry>

    <entry key="DataMoveIntoDifferentArchiveType">
      Serialized data is being moved between incompatible archive types. The
      archive being operated has identifier ''{0}'' and passed-in archive has
      identifier ''{1}'',
    </entry>

    <entry key="DataMoveIntoNonEmptyArchive">
      Serialized data is being moved into an archive with identifier ''{0}''
      which already has data inside it. Explicitly move and discard the data
      before attempting this operation.
    </entry>

    <entry key="DataQueueIsEmptyOnDeserialization">
      When de-serializing object with identifier ''{0}'', an attempt was made to
      access data member of type ''{1}'' which is not available. This indicates
      that serialized data is not compatible with the de-serialized object.
    </entry>

    <entry key="DataQueueHasIncorrectSizeOnDeserialization">
      When de-serializing object with identifier ''{0}'', an attempt was made to
      access {2} data members of type ''{1}'', while the size of the queue is
      {3}. This indicates that serialized data is not compatible with the
      de-serialized object.
    </entry>

    <entry key="RawDataMismatchOnDeserialization">
      Data tracker reports that the value {0} and {1} are not same for archive
      with id ''{2}''.
    </entry>

    <entry key="ErrorInSerializationTraits">
      There was an error in serialization traits for type ''{0}'' because of the
      following cause: ''{1}''.
    </entry>

    <entry key="InMemoryDataFormatIsInconsistent">
      In-memory data format being used to create an input archive for
      de-serialization is inconsistent with the format used for serialization.
    </entry>

    <entry key="FieldNotFoundInData">
      Requested field ''{0}'' was not found in the serialized data.
    </entry>

    <entry key="MetadataDoesNotExist">
      Metadata for serialized data with identifier ''{0}'' does not
      exist. Either it was not saved and written during serialization or it was
      not loaded when reading serialized data.
    </entry>
