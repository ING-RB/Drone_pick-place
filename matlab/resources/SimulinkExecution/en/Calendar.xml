  <message>
    <entry key="ActionIsNotSupportedForTarget">
      Action is not supported for action type specified for the target ''{0}''.
    </entry>

    <entry key="CanceledDateHasOneOrMoreDependency">
      Date ''{0}'' is being canceled, however, it has one or more existing dependency ''{1}''.
    </entry>

    <entry key="DateDoesNotExist">
      Date does not exist: {0}.
    </entry>

    <entry key="DateIsNotSupportedInComposedExpression">
      Date ''{0}'' is not supported in composed expression.
    </entry>

    <entry key="LogicalOperationIsNotSupported">
      Specified logical operation ''{0}'' is not supported in this schedule context.
    </entry>

    <entry key="LogicalOperationIsNotSupportedForNonTimedContext">
      Specified logical operation ''{0}'' is not supported for clock, rates or dates that are not
      timer driven.
    </entry>

    <entry key="NonFiniteTimeCannotBeScheduled">
      An attempt was made to schedule non-finite time {0} as the stepping time of the simulation
      at time {1}. Simulation can only take finite steps.
    </entry>

    <entry key="PeriodOrStartTimeIsNegativeOrNonFinite">
      The start time or period {1} specified for date ''{0}'' is non finite or negative. Set the
      period and start time to a strictly positive finite value.
    </entry>

    <entry key="ReleasedDateHasActions">
      Date ''{0}'' being released has registered actions. The date semantics can change on release and
      hence, actions are not allowed for a date being released. Cancel the actions before release.
    </entry>

    <entry key="ScheduledTimeIsLessThanCurrentTime">
      A scheduled time {0} is less than the current simulation time {1}. This request was made by
      ''{2}''.
    </entry>

    <entry key="ScheduledTimeWasNotFound">
      Previously scheduled time {0} was not found.
    </entry>

    <entry key="SubscriptionTopicNotSupported">
      A subscription request was made on clock or sequence ''{0}'' for topic ''{1}''. This topic is
      either not supported by the object or does not make sense in its context (for example,
      subscribed state cannot be reached by that object).
    </entry>

    <entry key="TimedDateCannotBeCreated">
      Timed date could not be created: {0}.
    </entry>

    <entry key="TimedDateImplementationDoesNotSupportAppend">
      Timed date implementation having the identifier ''{0}'' does not support appending time.
