      <entry key="StopTimeLessOrEqualToSnapshotTime">
        The simulation of the model ''{0}'' was terminated because the specified stop time {1} is less than or equal to the snapshot time stored in the initial ModelOperatingPoint. Specify a stop time which is greater than the snapshot time {2} to continue the simulation.

    <entry key="CannotSaveOPForModelInRaccel">Saving or restoring the operating point for model ''{0}'' is not supported in rapid accelerator simulation mode due to multiple reasons. </entry>

    <entry key="CannotSaveOPForModelWithPWork">Saving or restoring the operating point for model ''{0}'' is not supported in rapid accelerator simulation mode because block ''{1}'' stores pointers in its work vectors. To enable operating point on this model, use Normal mode simulation.</entry>
    <entry key="CannotSaveOPForModelWithDisallowedOP">Saving or restoring the operating point for model ''{0}'' is not supported because block ''{1}'' sets its operating point compliance to DISALLOW_OPERATING_POINT.</entry>

To enable operating point, use Normal mode simulation.</entry>
    <entry key="CannotSaveOPForModelWithStrings">Saving or restoring the operating point for model ''{0}'' is not supported in rapid accelerator simulation mode because model ''{0}'' uses 'String' datatype. To enable operating point, use Normal mode simulation. </entry>
    <entry key="CannotSaveOPForModelOther">Saving or restoring the operating point for model ''{0}'' is not supported in rapid accelerator simulation mode because block ''{1}'' does not support operating point. To enable operating point, use Normal mode simulation.</entry>
    <entry key="CannotSaveOPForModelWithLocalSolver">Saving or restoring the operating point for model ''{0}'' is not supported in rapid accelerator simulation mode because model ''{0}'' uses a local solver. To enable operating point, use Normal mode simulation.</entry>
    <entry key="OverridingSolverMaxStepSizeAuto">Operating point restore is overriding the solver setting for max step size from ''auto'' to ''{0}''. To avoid this behavior, explicitly specify the solver max step size before saving model operating point. You can disable this diagnostic by setting ''Automatic solver parameter selection'' diagnostic to ''none'' in the Diagnostics page of the configuration parameters dialog.</entry>
