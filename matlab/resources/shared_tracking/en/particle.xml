        <entry key="ConstructorWrongNargin">Expected 0 or 2 inputs to the object, but found {0}.</entry>
        <entry key="PredParticlesWrongSize">Expected the array of predicted particles to have a size of ({0}). Instead its size was ({1}). Modify the StateTransitionFcn so it returns the correct number of particles.</entry>
        <entry key="LikelihoodWrongSize">Expected the measurement likelihood vector to have length {0}. Instead its length was {1}. Modify the MeasurementLikelihoodFcn so it returns one likelihood per particle.</entry>
        <entry key="CovarianceNotSymmetric">Expected the covariance matrix to be symmetric. Ensure that the matrix is symmetric.</entry>
        <entry key="CovarianceNotPositiveSemiDefinite">Expected the covariance matrix to be positive semi-definite. Instead it has {0} negative eigenvalues. Ensure that the matrix is positive semi-definite.</entry>
        <entry key="ReadOnlyPropertySeeInitialize">You cannot set the read-only property ''{0}'' of ParticleFilter. Use the {1} function to modify this property.</entry>
        <entry key="PolicyCopyNotScalar">The copy operation can only operate on a scalar {0} object.</entry>
        <entry key="MustInitializeBeforeThisOperation">You must use the {0} function at least once before you perform this operation.</entry>
        <entry key="InitializeInvalidInputs">Expected 2 or 3 input arguments followed by optional name-value pairs, but found {0}.</entry>     
        <entry key="CallGetStateEstimate">Use the {0} function to see the value.</entry>
