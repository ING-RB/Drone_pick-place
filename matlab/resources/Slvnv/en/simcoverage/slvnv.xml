    <entry key="McdcTooManyPredicates">MCDC coverage not recorded for "{0}", because there are too many conditions within the MCDC expression.\nThe tool supports MCDC analysis for XOR or NXOR logic blocks with up to 12 inputs. </entry>
    <entry key="McdcTooComplex">MCDC coverage not recorded for "{0}", because a logic expression for this model object was too complex.</entry>
	<entry key="SkippedNestedMCDCLogging">Unable to record MCDC for logical expression "{0}" of {1} for at least one time step because the outcome of a condition was evaluated multiple times before the overall expression outcome was determined. This can occur when a logical expression contains a recursive function call.</entry>
