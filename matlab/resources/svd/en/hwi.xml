<!--Hardware Interrupt Error Messages -->
<entry key="HwiMaskInputNotACellArray">Expected input must be a cell array of character array.</entry>
<entry key="NotSameISRBlocksErrorMsg">Incorrect hardware interrupt block found in model. Hardware Interrupt block does not support {0} hardware board. Use hardware interrupt block supporting "{0}" hardware board.</entry>
<entry key="InterruptEventsNotSelected">At least an event must be selected from "Events to serve" group.</entry>
<entry key="MultipleUsageErrorMsg">The {0} is already used by another {1} block.</entry>
<entry key="BeyondPriorityLevelsMsg">Selected hardware board only allows {0} different levels of Simulink task priorities. Reduce the number of unique Simulink task priorities in the Hardware Interrupt blocks present in the model.</entry>
<entry key="BasePriorityNotUniqueErrorMsg">The Simulink task priority of the block is set to the same priority level as the base rate of the model. This use case is not supported. Change the Simulink task priority of the block to a different level.</entry>
<entry key="BasePriorityNotLowestErrorMsg">The Simulink task priority of the block is set to a lower or equal priority level compared to the base rate of the model. This use case is not supported for ARM Cortex-M0/M0+/M1 based processors. Change the Simulink task priority of the block to a higher priority level than {0}, which is currently set as the priority level of the base rate of the model.</entry>
<entry key="IncompatibleISRBlocksErrorMsg">{0} hardware interrupt block supports "{1}" hardware boards. {0} hardware interrupt block is not compatible to use with model set with hardware board "{2}".</entry>
