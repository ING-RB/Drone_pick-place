        <entry key="RHSVectorAllZero">The right hand side vector is all zero so {0}\nreturned an all zero solution without iterating.</entry>

        <entry key="StoppedScalarTooSmallOrLarge">{0} stopped at {1} without converging to the desired tolerance {2}\nbecause a scalar quantity became too small or too large to continue computing.</entry>
        <entry key="StoppedMethodStagnated">{0} stopped at {1} without converging to the desired tolerance {2}\nbecause the method stagnated.</entry>
        <entry key="StoppedMaxIterations">{0} stopped at {1} without converging to the desired tolerance {2}\nbecause the maximum number of iterations was reached.</entry>
        <entry key="StoppedPreconditionerSystemIllCond">{0} stopped at {1} without converging to the desired tolerance {2}\nbecause the system involving the preconditioner was ill conditioned.</entry>
        <entry key="StoppedPreconditionerNotSymPosDef">{0} stopped at {1} without converging to the desired tolerance {2}\nbecause the preconditioner is not symmetric positive definite.</entry>
