    <entry key="reseedLegacy">The current random number generator is the legacy generator.  This is because you have executed a command such as rand(''state'',0), which activates MATLAB''s legacy random number behavior.  You may not use RNG to reseed the legacy random number generator.\n\nUse rng(''default'') to reinitialize the random number generator to its startup configuration, or call RNG using a specific generator type, such as rng(seed,''{0}'').</entry>
    <entry key="createLegacy">''Legacy'' is not a valid choice for GENERATOR.  You may not switch to the legacy generator using rng(seed,''legacy'').\n\nYou may save and restore the legacy random number generator settings via s = rng; ... rng(s).  However, using the legacy random number generator is not recommended.  Instead, use one of the current generators, e.g. rng(seed,''{0}'').</entry>
