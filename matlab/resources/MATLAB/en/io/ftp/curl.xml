         that shouldn't occur during normal operation.
         These error messages are indicative of a MATLAB installation/configuration failure,
         or a misuse of the curl library by downstream MathWorks components.
         For example a misconfiguration of OpenSSL might lead to one of these messages,
         but a file-not-found error should not be in here. -->
