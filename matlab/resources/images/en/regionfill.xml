    <entry key="maskIsAllWhite" note="">The input mask covers the entire image and contains no boundary pixels. Pixels on the outer boundary of the input mask are used as boundary condition to solve the soap film PDE over the mask pixels. The resulting image will be black. Please check that the input mask does not cover the entire image.</entry>
    <entry key="notEnoughVertices" note="">No region to fill. To define a polygon, you must specify 3 or more vertices.</entry>
