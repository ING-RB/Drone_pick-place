    <entry key="mustBe2D" note="">Input image {0} must be a 2-D grayscale image.</entry> 
    <entry key="mustBe2Dor3D" note="">Input image {0} must be a 2-D or 3-D image.</entry>
    <entry key="differentMatrixSize" note="">Size of arrays {0} and {1} should be the same.</entry>    
    <entry key="vanishingContour" note="">Iterations terminated prematurely because no part of the contour lies within the image domain. If the range of pixel values in the input image is small (such as 0-1), consider increasing the range by multiplying the input image with a scale factor. Also, consider specifying a different initial contour position in {0}. </entry>
    <entry key="inconsistentStateEdgeBased" note="">Size of {0} is not consistent with the current state of {1} object. Consider calling {2} method the {3} object.</entry>
    <entry key="invalidSpeedObject" note="">{0} is not a valid ACTIVECONTOURSPEED object.</entry>
    <entry key="tooManyInputsInMethod" note="">Too many input arguments were passed to {0} method of {1} class.</entry>
    <entry key="edgeNotSupportedForColor" note="">The 'edge' method is not supported for color or vector-valued images.</entry>
    <entry key="edgeNotSupportedFor3D" note="">The 'edge' method is not supported in codegen for 3D images.</entry>
    <entry key="ErrorSettingUpActivecontour" note="">Error setting up activecontour. No image was loaded into the evolver, so the dimensionality is ambiguous.</entry>
