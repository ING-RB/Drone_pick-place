    <entry key="warnForLargeRadiusRange" note="">You just called {0} with a large radius range. Large radius ranges reduce algorithm accuracy and increase computational time. For high accuracy, relatively small radius range should be used. A good rule of thumb is to choose the radius range such that {1} and {2}. If you have a large radius range, say {3}, consider breaking it up into multiple sets and call {4} for each set separately, like this:\n\n{5}\n </entry>
    <entry key="warnForSmallRadius" note="">You just called {0} with very small radius value(s). Algorithm accuracy is limited for radius values less than or equal to 5.\n </entry>
