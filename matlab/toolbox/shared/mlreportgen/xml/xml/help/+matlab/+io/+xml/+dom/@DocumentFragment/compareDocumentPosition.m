%compareDocumentPosition Compare relative position of this fragment
%    posEnum = compareDocumentPosition(thisFragment,otherNode) returns 35,
%    a value that indicates that this fragment bears no relationship to 
%    the position of the other node in the document. This is because a 
%    document fragment is never a child of a document.
