This folder contains a template that the Section (and Chapter) reporter
use to generate PDF output. The template is a compressed (zipped) OPC 
package of HTML and related files that specify the static content and
page layout of the Section (or Chapter) PDF output. To customize the
reporter's PDF output, edit the contents of this template.

NOTE. The Chapter reporter uses the Section reporter template. Thus the
template documentation in this file applies to the Chapter reporter as well.

PDF TEMPLATE PACKAGE

The Section reporter template conforms to the Open Packaging Convention
(OPC) for XML files. The template package is a collection of files that 
includes metadata that describes the content of the package. The package 
is stored in compressed (zipped) forn. To customize the template, you 
must unzip the package and edit its contents. To use the customized 
template, you must rezip it. The MATLAB Report Generator provides 
functions for zipping and unzipping the template. The functions preserve
the OPC metadata. You must use these functions to avoid losing required
metadata.

ZIPPING AND UNZIPPING THE DEFAULT SECTION PDF TEMPLATE

To unzip the template:

1. Change the current MATLAB directory to the directory containing
   the default Section reporter PDF template.

2. Enter

   unzipTemplate("default.pdftx");

   at the MATLAB command line. A folder named "default" appears in the
   current directory. The folder contains the default Section reporter 
   PDF template.

To zip the template:

1. Change the current MATLAB working directory to the template directory
   if the current directory is not alread the working directory.

 2. Remove any temporary files, such as MATLAB .asv files, from the
    default directory.

2. Enter

   zipTemplate("default.pdftx");

   at the MATLAB command line. MATLAB overwrites the existing default.pdftx
   file with the contents of the default directory.

CONTENTS OF THE DEFAULT PDF TEMPLATE

The default template contains the following files:

* root.html

This is the main PDF template document. The Section (Chapter) reporter
does not use the contents of this file as a template. Instead, it uses the 
content of the templates defined in this template package's 
docpart_templates.html file.

* docpart_templates.html

  This file contains a library of templates used by the Section reporter
  to generate its output. The templates include comments describing their
  contents and usage.

     NOTE: The MATLAB Report Generator defines a custom set of HTML
     elements for creating holes and document part libraries in HTML and
     PDF templates and for creating page layouts in PDF templates. This 
     file uses these custom elements to define the Section template 
     library. The MATLAB Report Generator also supports use of many but
     not all standard HTML elements in PDF templates. This template library
     uses only the supported standard elements. If you customize this
     template, your customizations should use only the supported custom 
     and standard HTML elements. See 
     "Create PDF Document Part Template Library"
     in the MATLAB Report Generator documentation for information on the 
     HTML elements supported for use in Section reporter templates.

  This template library includes the following document part
  templates:

    * Section 1

      This template defines the content and page layout of a top-level
      section. It contains the following elements

      - Title hole. The Section (or Chapter) reporter fills this hole
        with the title of the top-level section, e.g. 
        "Chapter 1. Introduction".

      - Content hole. The Section (Chapter) reporter fills this hole with
        the value of the reporter's Content property. 

      - Page Layout. The page layout defines the page layout of the
        top-level section and all its subsections. The page layout 
        includes page margins, orientation (portrait, landscape), and page
        headers and footers. The page layout defines separate headers 
        and footers for the first  page of a section, for even pages, and 
        for odd pages.

     * Section 2 - Section 6

       These templates define the content of a section's subsections via 
       Title and Content holes, respectively. The Section reporter uses the
       Section 2 template to define the output of a Section appended to a 
       Section reporter. It uses the Section 3 template to define the output
       of a Section appended to a top-level section, etc.

     * SectionNumberedTitle1 - SectionNumberedTitle6

       These templates define the content of hierarchically numbered
       titles of level 1-6 sections. If the Numbered property of a Section
       reporter is true, the Section reporter uses these templates
       to generate the titles that it uses to fill the Title holes of
       Section 1-6 templates.

     * SectionTitle1 - SectionTitle6

       These templates define the content of unnumbered titles of level 1-6
       sections. If the Numbered property of a Section reporter is false, 
       the Section reporter uses these templates to generate section
       titles.

     * SectionFirstPageHeader

       This template defines the content of the header of the first page
       in a section.

     * SectionEvenPageHeader

       This template defines the content of the header of the even pages
       of a section.

     * SectionDefaultPageHeader

       This template defines the content of the header of the odd pages
       of a section. This template also specifies the content of the 
       headers for other pages (first page or even pages) if the section
       page layout does not specify headers for those pages.

     * SectionFirstPageFooter

       This template defines the content of the footer of the first page
       in a section.

     * SectionEvenPageFooter

       This template defines the content of the footer of the even pages
       of a section.

     * SectionDefaultPageFooter

       This template defines the content of the footer of the odd pages
       of a section. This template also specifies the content of the 
       footers for other pages (first page or even pages) if the section
       page layout does not specify footers for those pages.
    

* stylesheets/root.css

  This file defines the styles for the section titles, body content, and
  header and footer content generated by the Section reporter. You can 
  customize the appearance of the titles, body content, and header and
  footer content by changing the title properties in this file,
  such as font-size.

  You can also use this file to define styles for content elements that
  you add to the template.

* images folder

  This folder is intended to be used to store image files referenced by
  template document part elements. The Section reporter does not by default
  use any images. Thus, this folder is empty by default. If your customized
  template uses images, store the image files in this directory. To 
  include an image in a customized document part template, add an img 
  element where you want the image to appear, store the image file in this
  folder, and uses a relative path to specify the image file location,
  for example,

  <img src="images/CompanyLogo.svg"/>

* images/_imageprefix

  This file specifies a prefix for the names of image files appended to
  the FO output generated by the Section reporter. The FO output is used
  to generate the PDF output of the Section reporter. This prefix is 
  intended to prevent naming conflicts between names copied from the
  files in the template images folder and names generated when images
  are added to a section during report generation. The default value of
  the prefix is "image". You should either avoid adding images to the
  tamplate images folder whose name begins with the prefix or change the
  value of the prefix. For example, either avoid adding an image file 
  named "image1.svg" to the images folder or change the name of the prefix
  to something other than "image".
