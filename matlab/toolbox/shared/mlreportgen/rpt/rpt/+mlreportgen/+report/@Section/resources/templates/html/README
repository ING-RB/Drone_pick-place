This folder contains templates that the Section and Chapter reporter
use to generate HTML output. The templates include

* default.htmt

  The Section reporter uses this template to generate single-file HTML
  output

* default.htmtx

  The Section reporter uses this template to generate a report as a package
  of HTML and associated files. This template is a compressed (zipped) OPC
  package of HTML and related  files that specify the static content of 
  the HTML output of a Section (or Chapter) reporter and holes for filling 
  the output with dynamic content. 

NOTE. The Chapter reporter uses the Section reporter template. Thus the
template documentation in this file applies to the Chapter reporter as 
well.

DEFAULT.HTMTX TEMPLATE PACKAGE

This packaged template conforms to the Open Packaging Convention
(OPC) for XML files. The template package is a collection of files that 
includes metadata that describes the content of the package. The package 
is stored in compressed (zipped) form. To customize the template, you 
must unzip the package and edit its contents. To use the customized 
template, you must rezip it. The MATLAB Report Generator provides 
functions for zipping and unzipping the template. The functions preserve
the OPC metadata. You must use these functions to avoid losing required
metadata.

ZIPPING AND UNZIPPING THE PACKAGED TEMPLATE

To unzip the packaged template:

1. Change the current MATLAB directory to the directory containing
   the default.htmtx template.

2. Enter

   unzipTemplate("default.htmtx");

   at the MATLAB command line. A folder named "default" appears in the
   current directory. The folder contains the default Section reporter 
   HTML template.

To zip the template:

1. Change the current MATLAB working directory to the template directory
   if the current directory is not alread the working directory.

 2. Remove any temporary files, such as MATLAB .asv files, from the
    default directory.

2. Enter

   zipTemplate("default.htmtx");

   at the MATLAB command line. MATLAB overwrites the existing default.htmtx
   file with the contents of the default directory.

CONTENTS OF THE DEFAULT HTML TEMPLATE PACKAGE

The default template contains the following files:

* root.html

This is the main HTML template document. The Section (Chapter) reporter
does not use the contents of this file as a template. Instead, it uses the 
content of the templates defined in this template package's 
docpart_templates.html file.

* docpart_templates.html

  This file contains a library of templates used by the Section reporter
  to generate its HTML output. The templates include comments describing
  their contents and usage.

  This template library includes the following document part
  templates:

    * Section1 - Section6

      The Section and Chapter reporters use these templates to generate
      HTML output. A Section or Chapter reporter added to a report uses
      the Section1 template. A Section reporter added to a Chapter
      reporter or a top-level Section reporter uses the Section2 
      template, and so on. Each template contains the following holes:

      - Title hole. The Section (or Chapter) reporter fills this hole
        with the text value of the reporter's Title property. If the
        reporter's Numbered property is true, the reporter uses the
        SectionNumberedTitleN template (see below) to format the title,
        where N is the level number of the section in the report 
        hierarchy. If the reporter's Numbered property is false, the
        reporter uses the SectionTitleN template (see below) to format
        the title content.

      - Content hole. The Section (Chapter) reporter fills this hole with
        the value of the reporter's Content property. 

     * SectionNumberedTitle1 - SectionNumberedTitle6

       These templates define the content of hierarchically numbered
       titles of level 1-6 sections. If the Numbered property of a Section
       reporter is true, the Section reporter uses these templates
       to generate the titles that it uses to fill the Title holes of
       Section 1-6 templates.

     * SectionTitle1 - SectionTitle6

       These templates define the content of unnumbered titles of level 1-6
       sections. If the Numbered property of a Section reporter is false, 
       the Section reporter uses these templates to generate section
       titles.
    

* stylesheets/root.css

  This file defines the styles for the section titles and body content  
  generated by the Section reporter. You can customize the appearance of
  the titles, body content by changing the title properties in this file,
  such as font-size.

  You can also use this file to define styles for content elements that
  you add to the template.

* images folder

  This folder is intended to be used to store image files referenced by
  template document part elements. The Section reporter does not by default
  use any images. Thus, this folder is empty by default. If your customized
  template uses images, store the image files in this directory. To 
  include an image in a customized document part template, add an img 
  element where you want the image to appear, store the image file in this
  folder, and uses a relative path to specify the image file location,
  for example,

  <img src="images/CompanyLogo.svg"/>

* images/_imageprefix

  This file specifies a prefix for the names of image files appended to
  the HTML output generated by the Section reporter. This prefix is 
  intended to prevent naming conflicts between names copied from the
  files in the template images folder and names generated when images
  are added to a section during report generation. The default value of
  the prefix is "image". You should either avoid adding images to the
  tamplate images folder whose name begins with the prefix or change the
  value of the prefix. For example, either avoid adding an image file 
  named "image1.svg" to the images folder or change the name of the prefix
  to something other than "image".
