properties
     %CurrentHoleId Id of current hole
     %      This property specifies the id of the hole at which this
     %      form (document or document part) is currently positioned. 
     %      Any objects appended to this document are appended after
     %      the template content that preceded this hole.
     CurrentHoleId;

     %CurrentHoleType Type of the current hole (block or inline)
     %      Specified the type of this hole: block or inline. Inline
     %      holes occur only in paragraphs. Thus, you can append to an
     %      inline hole only types of objects that paragraphs can contain,
     %      for example, text and images, but not paragraphs or tables.
     CurrentHoleType;

     %CurrentPageLayout Current page layout properties
     %      The value of this property is an object of PageLayout type
     %      that specifies the properties of the current page layout.
     %      You can use this object to set the properties of the
     %      current page layout, e.g., page height and width, margins, 
     %      headers and footers.
     CurrentPageLayout;

     %TemplatePath Path of this document's template
     %     Path of the Word or HTML template for this document. If this 
     %     property is empty, a default template is used to generate the
     %     document. This property cannot be changed after a document has
     %     been opened for output.
     TemplatePath;

     %Type Output type of this document (docx, html, html-file, html-multipage, pdf)
     %      Specifies the output type of this document: docx, html,
     %      html-file, html-multipage, or pdf. You cannot set this property
     %      after the document has been opened.
     Type;

     %DOCXVersion Version of Word supported by this document
     %      Content of this document.
     DOCXVersion;

     %OpenStatus Open status of this document
     %      Specifies the current status of this DOM object. The object is
     %      in open state when the open method is executed on it and
     %      remains open until the close method is called on it. This is a
     %      read-only property.
