%DIFFCODE  Global alignment algorithm applied to file diffs
%   [align1,align2,score] = DIFFCODE(seq1,seq2) computes
%   the alignment arrays and alignment score between sequences 
%   seq1 and seq2. The sequences can be a cell array of strings
%   or a list of numbers of any numeric type. If the sequences
%   are cell arrays of strings then whitespace is ignored
%   during the alignment.
