classdef TimedElasticBandCarGraph < handle & nav.algs.internal.InternalAccess
%TimedElasticBandCarGraph creates a graph for Timed Elastic Band optimizer
%for Car-like robots.
%   It contains the information about the graph which contains metadata for
%   the graph and necessary information required for the computation of
%   errors, Jacobians, gradients, and Hessians. For Timed Elastic band
%   formulation lot of the graph information is directly dependent on input
%   path, hence, some of that information is not stored. For e.g. motion
%   edges are always between consecutive poses, making storing of motion
%   edges redundant.
%
%   This graph computes errors, cost, gradients, hessians while considering
%   12 types of edges, where 1 is primary objective of the cost function
%   and other 11 are considered as soft-constraints added to cost function.
%       1. Time component of the cost function.
%       2. Non-holonomic motion edge constraints
%       3. Min Turning radius edge constraints
%       4. Velocity edge constraints
%       5. Angular Velocity edge constraints
%       6. Acceleration edge constraints
%       7. Angular Acceleration edge constraints
%       8. Acceleration at Start edge constraints
%       9. Angular Acceleration at Start edge constraints
%       10. Acceleration at End edge constraints
%       11. Angular Acceleration at End edge constraints
%       12. Obstacle edge constraints
