% MATLAB is used by engineers and scientists worldwide to analyze and
% design the systems and products transforming our world. MATLAB is in
% automobile active safety systems, interplanetary spacecraft, health
% monitoring devices, smart power grids, and LTE cellular networks. It is
% used for machine learning, signal processing, image processing, computer
% vision, communications, computational finance, control design, robotics,
% and much more.
% 
% The MATLAB platform is optimized for solving engineering and scientific
% problems. The matrix-based MATLAB language is the world's most natural
% way to express computational mathematics. Built-in graphics make it easy
% to visualize and gain insights from data. A vast library of pre-built
% toolboxes lets you get started right away with algorithms essential to
% your domain. The desktop environment invites experimentation,
% exploration, and discovery. These MATLAB tools and capabilities are all
% rigorously tested and designed to work together.
% 
% MATLAB helps you take your ideas beyond the desktop. You can run your
% analyses on larger data sets, and scale up to clusters and clouds. MATLAB
% code can be integrated with other languages, enabling you to deploy
% algorithms and applications within web, enterprise, and production
% systems.
