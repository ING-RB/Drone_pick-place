    % * Check file dependencies and problems before sharing as an archive.
    % * Perform an impact analysis to find the impact of changing
    % particular files.
    % * Export the dependency analysis results as workspace variables,
    % .graphml files, an image, or an archive. 
    % * Create a project from the file dependency graph. Creating a project
    % enables you to package, share, or put your design under source
    % control.
