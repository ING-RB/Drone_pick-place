%rootProject  Get root project
%    project = matlab.project.rootProject returns the currently loaded root
%    project in the currently loaded project reference hierarchy.

%    Unlike matlab.project.currentProject which will return the project
%    which currently has context, for instance if a shortcut is being
%    executed on a referenced project.
%
%    An empty array is returned if no project is loaded.
