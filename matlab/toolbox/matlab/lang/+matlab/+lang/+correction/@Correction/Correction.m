%CORRECTION  Superclass of all Correction classes.
%   A CORRECTION suggests a fix for an MException that is thrown and not
%   caught.
%
%   The CORRECTION class is an abstract class and cannot be directly
%   constructed. It is the superclass for all classes and follows handle
%   semantics.
%
%   Classes that are derived from CORRECTION inherit no properties or
%   methods.
