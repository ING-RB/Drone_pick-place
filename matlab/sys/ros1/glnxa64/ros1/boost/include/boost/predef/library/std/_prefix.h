We need to include an STD header to gives us the context
of which library we are using. The "smallest" code-wise header
seems to be <exception>. Boost uses <utility> but as far
as I can tell (RR) it's not a stand-alone header in most
implementations. Using <exception> also has the benefit of
being available in EC++, so we get a chance to make this work
for embedded users. And since it's not a header impacted by TR1
there's no magic needed for inclusion in the face of the
Boost.TR1 library.
