The DocBook DSSSL component was created by extracting:

1. Extracting the original DocBook DSSSL package from sourceforge.net
2. Adding the following Mathworks support files.  These files should migrate over to the mwsupport_openjade component but were not because moving them required source code changes.
   * contrib/header/header.dsl
   * contrib/textlink/textlink.dsl
   * print/mcode.dsl
   * print/param.xml
   * print/param.xsl
   * html/param.xml
   * html/param.xsl
